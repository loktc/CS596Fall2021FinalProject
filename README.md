Introduction:
Alzheimerâ€™s disease, the most common form of dementia, has challenged human beings for century.  
An early detection would be a great strategy for patients to slow or prevent disease progression.  
Our group would like to use deep learning approaches to help detect for early stage of Alzheimer.

Data Set:
- Human brain MRI images
- Main differences between patients and healthy individuals: brain volume
- Souce: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) from USC's Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute
