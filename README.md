Introduction:
Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, has challenged human beings for century.  
An early detection would be a great strategy for patients to slow or prevent disease progression.  
Our group would like to use deep learning approaches to help detect for early stage of Alzheimer.

Data Set:
- Human brain MRI images
- Main differences between patients and healthy individuals: brain volume
- Souce: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) from USC's Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute 

Cognitive normal vs Alzheimer’s disease:
![]()

Model:
1. Pytorch
2. CNN

Expected Results:
Train the ML model successfully and the estimated success rate of images recognition between normal human brain and Alzheimer’s disease is at least 80%.
